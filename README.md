# Sentiment-Analysis-using-LSTM
This repository aims to explain the concepts of Natural Language Processing and how to build a model using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory), a deep learning algorithm for performing sentiment analysis
LONG SHORT TERM MEMORY:
Before getting into LSTM, letâ€™s understand quickly what RNN does?

RNN is a type of supervised deep learning algorithm. Here, the neurons are connected to themselves through time. The idea behind RNN is to remember what information was there in the previous neurons so that these neurons could pass information to themselves in the future for further analysis. It means that the information from a specific time instance (t1) is used as an input for the next time instance(t2). This is the idea behind RNN.
